Granite "Grant"

character profile:
Jive af. Hailed as "the best f*cking scat singer" by Scatman John himself.

bio:
Grant grew up in a small NJ town, working mornings at gas stations and practicing his jazz singing in his garage at night. He started going to karaoke bars, becoming a mainstay and gaining moderate popularity in
the tri-county area. He started performing at local clubs and bars, where he was introduced to some of the local legends, who after hearing his distinct quick-talking style encouraged Grant to find his own path
when his cover songs weren't enough to make him stand out. He began trying out some new styles utilizing his quicker paced vocal method, but found he was complete shit when it came to writing lyrics. As a work
around, he started replacing words with vocal "skeeps", "das", and "bops" that fit the jazzy beats and sounds of the songs he was writing. When he was demoing what he had for his friends, they immediately
made fun of him, but also couldn't get those scattered rhythms out of their head. He started to perform what he dubbed "jazz rap" in the local clubs, getting laughed out of each place that he used to be a usual
preformer at. In one such club, Scatman John heard one of his jazz rap performances, and when he couldn't get the tunes out of his head the next day, he came back looking for Grant. They spent the next few months
practicing together so that John could use that style for an album he was getting together. He renamed the jazz rap style as "Scat" to dissassociate himself with the laughing stock of New Jersey, and his album
<i>Scatman's World</i> went on to put John on the map with his hit "Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)". Grant never got the public notoriety for inventing the scat style, and couldn't make it out of the local clubs
that took him back in after hearing the success of Scatman's World. He continued to write jazz and produced a couple albums for artists like Gary Burton and BadBadNotGood.
